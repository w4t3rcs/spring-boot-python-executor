/**
 * Implementation of {@link PythonResolverHolder} that holds a list of {@link PythonResolver}
 * and applies them sequentially to a Python script.
 * <p>
 * This class enables step-by-step transformation of the script through a chain of resolvers.
 * It is immutable â€” the list of resolvers is provided via constructor and does not change.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Usage example:
 * <pre>{@code
 * List<PythonResolver> resolvers = List.of(new SpelythonResolver(...), new Py4JResolver(...), ...);
 * PythonResolverHolder holder = new BasicPythonResolverHolder(resolvers);
 * String script = "...";
 * Map<String, Object> args = Map.of("key", value);
 * String resolved = holder.resolveAll(script, args);
 * }</pre>
